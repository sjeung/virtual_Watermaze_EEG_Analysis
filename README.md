# Project virtual Morris Water Maze - EEG analysis

This repository contains analysis and visualization scripts for virtual Morris Watermaze data set
collected 2019-2020 at the Berlin Mobile Brain-Body Imaging Lab, 
in collaboration between TU Berlin department of Biopsychology and Neuroergonomics and Charite department of Neurology.
The batch of Matlab script performs preprocessing of the EEG data and ERS/ERDS analysis alongside the analysis of motion capture data.
Data set contains 128 channels EEG data (BrainProducts)collected alongside HTC-Vive motion captuer of HMD, Torso, and both feet.
10 patients with right medial-temporal lesions navigated in mobile immersive VR environment and simulated desktop-based environment 
performing a human-scale variant of the Morris Water Maze task.
